                  And for them to be true, we designed special mangals (the ones and only) 
                  which enable to cook over an open fire for the ribs to be crispy and have 
                  a smoky taste. Prefer cooking ribs on your own? No problems! You may buy 
                  our marinade separately. It tastes well, not only for ribs. Rebernia is 
                  a democratic restaurant where there\`s no tableware and everyone eats 
                  with their hands (after all, itâ€™s more delicious). And, of course, there 
                  is no entrance in ties. But if someone wants his tie to be publicly cut 
                  and added to our collection - why not?`,
