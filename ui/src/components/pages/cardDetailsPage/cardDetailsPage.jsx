//                   which enable to cook over an open fire for the ribs to be crispy and have
//                   a smoky taste. Prefer cooking ribs on your own? No problems! You may buy
//                   our marinade separately. It tastes well, not only for ribs. Rebernia is
//                   a democratic restaurant where there\`s no tableware and everyone eats
//                   with their hands (after all, itâ€™s more delicious). And, of course, there
//                   is no entrance in ties. But if someone wants his tie to be publicly cut
//                   and added to our collection - why not?`,
